# WARNING! HERE THERE BE SPOILERS

This directory contains the original source code for the quiz pages, in case you're curious about how they're put together or how the answers are structured. These files are waul-compiled
together with the stuff in ../deps/, and the result is dropped into a giant <script> block in the generated webpages.

Don't read the files in this directory unless you want to know the answers to the quizzes!
