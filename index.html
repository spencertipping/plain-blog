  <h1>Occam's Razor</h1>
  <p>In real life, true facts are often both counterintuitive and simplifying. Finding out that the earth is round is a significant mental leap considering that it looks flat from every angle. But
it simplifies our perception of deeper questions like gravity, and it explains how airplanes can keep going west and end up where they started.</p>
  <p>The same is true of great platforms and frameworks. Rather than obscuring things or creating noise, they use a less-than-obvious presentation of something that ends up making your world a
simpler place.
</p>
</div>
<div class='section level1'>
  <h1>Great abstractions</h1>
  <p>jQuery didn't take long to become the dominant Javascript library, and it's easy to see why. For someone who already knows DOM programming, it's trivial to learn and provides great ways to get
stuff done with less work. jQuery also managed to achieve a kind of minimalism; you can't remove much without changing something fundamental. And for many purposes, it has replaced the DOM.</p>
  <p>Another platform like this is the C programming language. It allows you to write assembly-level code far faster than you could in assembly, and it conveniently obscures the details of
architecture/platform-specific instructions and ABIs. The vast majority of C programmers feel no need to look underneath the hood of GCC, the linker, the calling conventions, the standard C
library, or any number of other complex pieces of C's infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Each of these abstractions has an interesting property: people who use them rarely find the need to work around them. Put differently, these abstractions don't leak. Most abstractions, of
course, aren't like this. For instance, X11 implementations use direct-memory rendering for local connections to provide hardware acceleration. All of the rendering could be done over its
network protocol, but it would be dog-slow and nobody would use it.</p>
  <div class='section level2'>
    <h2>Good abstractions vanish</h2>
    <p>  CPU-bound programs written in Perl or Ruby usually take much longer to run than the same programs written in C. As such, there's a case to be made against, for example, writing ray-tracers
  or programming language interpreters in Perl. C, on the other hand, is not appreciably slower than assembly language for the vast majority of tasks. For most purposes, you'd never know the
  result wasn't written in assembly to begin with, except that C is so cool that nobody would do that. (Actually, this isn't true. C imposes a lot of structure on the resulting assembly that
  makes it easy to detect. But none of this structure impedes the program's functionality/performance very much.)</p>
    <p>  Like C, jQuery also doesn't add much overhead. Last time I <a target='_blank' href='http://spencertipping.com/js-instabench'>measured it</a>, the cost of creating a Javascript object is 1%
  of the cost of creating an HTML element; although jQuery isn't erased per se, it is such a thin layer, and it's so aggressively optimized, that jQuery itself is rarely the cause of
  performance problems.</p>
    <p>  Here's where things get slightly counterintuitive: both jQuery and C will generally result in a net performance <em>increase</em> despite each creating some overhead over the perfect
  hand-coded solution. Not only do the abstractions vanish, but they result in a faster end product. And we use these libraries because low performance is one of the most harmful side-effects
  that an application can have.</p>
    <p>  Put differently, asking the question, <em>is using this abstraction making my application slow</em> is just as problematic as asking, <em>is my app failing because this abstraction has a
  bug</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='section level2'>
    <h2>Good abstractions are culturally accessible</h2>
    <p>  jQuery uses CSS syntax to select things, and while it did invent (as far as I know) its own accessor/mutator convention, this was so unsurprising and easy to use that things like Java's
  getter/setter pattern looked clunky and outdated by comparison. C allowed programmers to keep doing the kinds of cool stuff you could do in assembly (pointer typecasting, computed jumps),
  but made it easier and less error-prone to write programs with consistent structure.</p>
    <p>  Also, and just as importantly, jQuery didn't present some grand unified replacement for the DOM. Instead, it leveraged one of the DOM's core properties (the structured node hierarchy) and
  made it accessible in a reliable, cross-browser way. C didn't try to manage memory, create a new paradigm, or ignore the fact that you're ultimately writing machine language. Instead, it
  embraced these things and made them work consistently across every major platform (at least as far as the end-programmer is concerned).</p>
    <p>  The last, and perhaps most important, component of accessibility is ergonomics. C is much terser than assembly language for common use cases, just as jQuery is often much terser than direct
  DOM programming.</p>
    <p>  C and jQuery aren't the only libraries that have great ergonomics, of course. The UNIX filesystem and shell are also so useful that there isn't a decisively better alternative. Ditto for
  text editors as IDE components, despite how non-textual most programs are. Whatever design flaws these systems have, their ease of use is so compelling that we don't want to switch away.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='section level2'>
    <h2>Great abstractions withstand adaptation</h2>
    <p>  Adaptation comes in two ways. One is when the abstraction author changes something, often breaking code that uses the abstraction. This happened with Ruby; 1.9.x isn't backwards-compatible
  with 1.8.x, yielding workarounds like the RVM. Perl and Javascript are examples of the opposite; they have preserved horrible design flaws throughout their evolution so that old programs
  would keep working without modification.</p>
    <p>  The other, and more interesting, form of adaptation is when people start misusing something. A great example of this is the C++ template system, which was probably in no way designed with
  the idea that people would be using it for general-purpose metaprogramming. The fact that this misuse is so reliable that it has become commonplace is a significant compliment to C++
  templates. They have held up to unforeseen use where a lesser system would have broken down. The Web is perhaps the greatest example of misuse; what started as a simple linked document
  management system has ended up nearly replacing desktop applications.
