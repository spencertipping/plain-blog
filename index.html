  <span class='date'>2012.0319</span>
  <div class='section level1'>
  <h1>The value of heuristics</h1>
  <p>Some problems don't have clean, elegant solutions. One example of this is object traversal in Javascript. I was working on a serialization library that crawled through a series of Javascript
objects, serializing each one and encoding the object graph as a series of references that could later be reconstructed. In order to do this, you need to be able to reliably mark each object
and be able to reverse-map objects to their IDs. And the catch is that Javascript only lets you use strings as object keys.</p>
  <p>The hard but correct way to do this is to keep an array of <code>[ID, object]</code> pairs that you could then search each time you encountered an object. But this is time-consuming; O(n^2)
overall. Better is to find some way to store the ID directly on each object. This can be done if you choose an extremely improbable name, like
<code>extremely_improbable_name_for_serialization_library</code>. But this approach breaks down once you want to serialize the source tree of your serializer (if you ever did want to do such a
thing), since the name is present verbatim.</p>
  <p>I ended up generating a pseudorandom name using at least 128 bits of entropy. This isn't too hard; Javascript identifier characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, $, _) encode 6 bits each, so 22 characters
contains 132 bits of information. I chose 128 because for a long time this was considered cryptographically secure; if you could guess someone's 128-bit key then you could see everything they
were saying to each other. Pseudorandom data isn't cryptographically secure, but it is difficult enough to predict that it seemed like a reasonable choice.</p>
  <p>The beauty of this solution is that it isn't correct, but it always works. If you can put an upper bound on the degree of pathology of your problem domain, then you don't have to implement
something that is universally functional; you just need to handle the most pathological case that comes your way.

<div id='post-2012.0315-too-little-structure'>
  <span class='date'>2012.0315</span>
  <div class='section level1'>
  <h1>Too little structure</h1>
  <p>Caterwaul's parser and syntax trees are much looser than the Javascript language specification. I did this mostly out of laziness; it seemed simpler to write an ad-hoc parser and stick to
operator-precedence parsing as much as possible. It turns out that my laziness enabled a whole range of very cool stuff to be done. For example, caterwaul can parse expressions like this:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>S[for (var L[i] = R[10]; R[i &lt; 10]) S[{_body}]]</pre>
  <p>This means that you can annotate arbitrary subtrees, including ones in statement mode (!), with markers and then pattern-match against those markers and their contents. Caterwaul has used this
for some time; the <code>seq</code> library uses it to descend through subtrees and parse out the sequence operators. And because the caterwaul parser handles all of the cases uniformly,
markers can be seamlessly integrated into <code>qs</code> and <code>qse</code> forms.</p>
  <p>The interesting thing about this is that I wouldn't have even thought of the marker approach had I been using a highly-structured parser and AST representation, and I would have worked harder
to write the parser and AST in the first place. So I've got a new approach: Write APIs with too little structure and fix it later.

  <span class='date'>2012.0312</span>
  <div class='section level1'>
  <h1>Type theory considered distracting</h1>
  <p>Assembly language is untyped. By the time you're writing assembly programs, all types have been erased into instruction patterns that happen to reflect the semantics of what you're doing. If
you're in a higher-level language, those semantics could even vary depending on runtime variants; the fixity of in-memory representation is, from what I can tell, primarily a historical nod to
low-level type erased languages that depend on it being a compile-time invariant. (And compacting garbage collectors loosen this restriction somewhat by making pointers opaque, so we're slowly
losing aspects of this codependency even in situations where it seems like it should be difficult.)</p>
  <p>C inherits its type system from the constraints of assembly language: Types were not particularly used to guarantee correctness or to prove complex compile-time invariants; rather, they
dictated the memory layout in a consistent way. And C has a desirable property because of this. All of its types can be erased at compile-time; there is no runtime type information. This isn't
always the fastest way to do things because of the overhead associated with x86 calling conventions and indirect jumps, but the type system arguably leaves off where it makes sense -- before
the program is run.</p>
  <p>Fast forward to the development of the JVM Hotspot compiler, which includes an impressive array of optimizations including <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching'
target='_blank'>inline caching</a> that deal specifically with compile-time unknowns whose runtime impact is generally mitigated by heuristic observation. There isn't anything wrong with
heuristic optimization; generational GC, for instance, makes a tremendous amount of sense. But it's worth thinking a bit about the kinds of optimizations that <em>didn't</em> happen even when
they would be relatively trivial to implement.</p>
  <p>For example, loop invariant-analyzing compilers do not, to the best of my knowledge, hoist invariants across function boundaries, even when the function is provably monomorphic. This matters
in languages like Javascript; for example:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>var process = function (data, x) {
  return (data instanceof Array ? f1 : f2)(data, x);
};
for (var i = 0; i &lt; xs.length; ++i)
  process(constant_array, xs[i]);</pre>
  <p>Here, <code>process</code> and <code>constant_array</code> are loop invariants, but even sophisticated compilers like V8 are unlikely to include an optimization step that inlines the loop body
into the single expression <code>f1(constant_array, xs[i])</code> even after executing it many times. However, if the dispatch were made implicit by using prototype methods, the inline cache
would kick in and provide a significant benefit.

  <span class='date'>2012.0307</span>
  <div class='section level1'>
  <h1>Developing without unit tests</h1>
  <p>About a year ago I removed caterwaul's unit tests. Now it has only a large functional test: can it bootstrap-compile itself? I think the change has been really good for the project, all things
considered.</p>
  <p>Tests are a time investment. You hope that the effort you spend maintaining tests is less than the amount of effort you would spend debugging/fixing regressions that would have occurred
without them. Whether or not this is true depends on a few factors, a significant one of which is how quickly the project requirements change. Caterwaul's API doesn't change very often, but
its internals change more often.</p>
  <p>Unit tests are also protection against other developers. I deliberately wrote caterwaul to be difficult for other developers to modify so I wouldn't need to worry about this (and because
writing software this way is just more fun IMO). I'm convinced that team development has some significant game theory problems, and unit tests mitigate these problems to some extent.</p>
  <p>Finally, caterwaul has had some interesting philosophical changes since I removed unit tests. It has gotten simpler because I needed to keep it manageable. If I tried to write some
ill-defined, complex library, something would break somewhere and it would take a lot of time to fix. The result is that the code is roughly uniform in its distribution of fragility *
modification frequency.

  <span class='date'>2012.0302</span>
  <div class='section level1'>
  <h1>A Caterwaul bug</h1>
  <p>Not all bugs are created equal. They range from the stupidly obvious mistakes of late-night coding to the intriguingly subtle nonlocal consequences of reasonable design decisions. In my
experience, most bugs tend towards the obvious side of this scale. But sometimes I run into a legendary bit of pathology that is so convoluted or mysterious that it qualifies as a work of art.
Yesterday I was fortunate enough to encounter one of these in Caterwaul.</p>
  <p>I was a little worried about it because I had seen it happen at least once before and had no idea why. The symptom was that, for some input programs that made heavy use of syntax quotation,
<code>waul</code> would die with output similar to the following:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>node.js:201
      throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
            ^
TypeError: Object , has no method 'reach'
    at eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119)
    at [object Object].each (eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119))
    at [object Object].reach (eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119))
    at eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119)
    at [object Object].each (eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119))
    at [object Object].reach (eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119))
    at eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119)
    at [object Object].each (eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119))
    at [object Object].reach (eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119))
    at eval at &lt;anonymous&gt; (waul-1.2:140:119)</pre>
  <p>One of the problems with writing your own programming language is that you also have to write your own debugger. Right now Caterwaul has no debugger, so figuring out why this was happening was
a real challenge. Fortunately, I had a hunch: I suspected that I was building a syntax tree with a string child instead of a syntax tree child. Caterwaul lets you use either as a convenience,
but the <code>push()</code> method of syntax trees doesn't do that conversion. So I refactored <code>push()</code> to use the same logic as the constructor and figured that would take care of
it.</p>
  <p>It didn't.</p>
  <p>Instead, I saw this in the generated output:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>... .call(this, ..., , , , , , , , );</pre>
  <p>Node was understandably unhappy. Also strange was that my <code>.qse</code> literal expression refs had been replaced by variables called <code>e1</code>, <code>e2</code>, etc (normally they'd
be called <code>qse1</code>, <code>qse2</code>, ...). At first I thought I had some macro that was re-expanding something and generating anonymous expression refs, so I poked around. To my
surprise, no macro like this existed in the Caterwaul standard library. This meant that the bug was in the Caterwaul core itself.</p>
  <p>I copied the failing program and started trimming it down until the problem went away. I found out that constructs like <code>'g[_x]'.qse /-f/ y</code> would cause an <code>e</code> variable
to be created. As soon as I got rid of the <code>/-f/ y</code>, the <code>qse</code> would behave normally. I then tried it out on the REPL and found the same strange behavior:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>$ waul -c js_all
waul&gt; '"foo".qse /-f/ bar'.qse.toString()
'f(qse_h_azCSgoP86KF16yaWYRruza)'             &lt;- notice: no 'bar'!
waul&gt; '"foo".qse / z /-f/ bar'.qse.toString()
'f(qse_j_azCSgoP86KF16yaWYRruza,z,bar)'       &lt;- now it's there</pre>
  <p>At this point it was clear that it was some strange case of the infix function syntax. After some more poking around and random guesses, I found that calling <code>flatten()</code> on
expression refs didn't work correctly. It turns out that tree coercion had a subtle bug in this function (it's written on one line in the Caterwaul source):</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>as: function (d) {
  return this.data === d
    ? this
    : new this.constructor(d).push(this);
}</pre>
  <p>This appeared to be doing the right thing: Either return the node or wrap it in a new <code>d</code> node and return that. It would be appropriately generic, too: <code>new
this.constructor</code> would be closed over the node type.</p>
  <p>And that's when everything made sense. Expression refs aren't instantiated like regular nodes. Most syntax trees take the "data", or their name, as the first argument. So if you said <code>new
caterwaul.syntax('foo')</code>, you'd have a syntax tree representing the identifier <code>foo</code>. But the expression ref and closure ref constructors are front-loaded to take the value
before the name. The name is entirely optional; normally Caterwaul will just use a gensym.</p>
  <p>The result of this was that when <code>flatten</code> was called on an expression ref, the expression ref was parenting itself with another expression ref, not a regular syntax node.
Expression refs don't have children, so this caused the original expression ref to be hidden and replaced by a nullary comma node. Expression refs serialize to their data, so the nullary comma
would be serialized as just ',', hence the syntactically incorrect output.</p>
  <p>Long story short, it turns out that <code>as</code> is an anomaly among tree transform methods in that it shouldn't respect type closure. The fix was to write it this way:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>as: function (d) {
  return this.data === d
    ? this
    : new caterwaul_global.syntax(d).push(this);
}</pre>
  <p>If only all bugs could be this cool.

  <div class='section level1'>
  <h1>Performance as a side effect</h1>
  <p>Someone on Twitter posed a good question recently: "What is state?" (that is, statefulness vs statelessness in code). I thought about that for a while. It's a difficult thing to pin down
because you could argue that any stored data is really state. My answer was that state is an implicit dependency on time.</p>
  <p>If it's true, this answer has some strange ramifications. For example, performance is another variable that involves time. And I would argue that something with unpredictable performance is,
in production scenarios, as dangerous as something that randomly emits side-effects. On the aggregate, it wouldn't surprise me if Java and C++ were actually the two languages with the highest
level of abstraction for the generally low total time dependency.

  <h1>Indirect jumps in GNU assembler</h1>
  <p>I'm not great at assembly-level programming, but I've been getting into it recently to implement a new programming language that I'll probably never finish. While working on it, I decided to
use some <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation_passing_style' target='_blank'>continuation-passing style</a> patterns to minimize the amount of stack manipulation that would need
to happen. So I started out with some code like this:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>movq continuation, %r12
jmp f
...
f:
...
jmp *%r12
...
continuation:</pre>
  <p>If you're familiar with AT&amp;T assembler syntax, you probably won't be surprised to hear that this segfaulted and <code>gdb</code> showed <code>%r12</code> as having a value way outside of the
program's code space. After a lot of reading online, it turns out that you need to do it this way:</p>
  <pre class='quoted'>movq $continuation, %r12</pre>
  <p>Linguistically, this makes sense: you're <code>jmp</code>ing to the code itself (which is similar to a dereference), but you're talking about the code's address when you put the value into a
register.

  <p>As a programmer who likes functional paradigms, I have a hard time accepting the fact that Java is so popular. But it is, and so much so that it's noteworthy. Great software is built in Java,
C++, C, and other very non-functional languages with tons of mutable state and edge-triggering. (For example, my OS, window manager, editor, terminal emulator, and browser are all written in
one of these languages.)</p>
  <p>I think there are some interesting dynamics behind Java's popularity and empirical success (and Haskell's empirical non-success, despite being signficantly more academically meritorious). What
is it that Java has that Haskell doesn't? My best guess is that Haskell gives you the ability to create tools easily; this is the default way of developing. So in order to make progress, you
are continuously defining abstractions. Put differently, you have the freedom, and the burden, of choosing your tools.</p>
  <p>Java is simple. It gives you one mediocre abstraction that leads to slow, complex, bug-ridden software. Its model of objects is, in my opinion, the wrong tool for any job. However, and this is
the genius of it, you don't have to think about your toolset. You just write stuff using the wrong tool, and slowly but surely you make progress without solving unnecessary problems.</p>
  <p>Another way to look at it is that this is a reflection of the software process as a whole: Most failures occur in the requirements phase, not design or implementation. By making programmers
think about their own requirements during the development phase, languages like Haskell create another point of failure. What interests me particularly is that this point of failure is
evidently so large that the average corporate programmer (even at Google!) is better off using the wrong tools than they are taking a shot at inventing their own. Maybe the true measure of a
programmer's usefulness is not their ability to write software, but their ability to know what needs to be written.

  <h1>Perfection is irrecoverable</h1>
  <p>Haskell emulates something close to perfection on an imperfect platform. Rather than embracing the platform's idiosyncrasies and imperfections, it attempts to create a world where they don't
exist. C, on the other hand, doesn't hide the fact that the platform is imperfect. It simply refines the world into a less imperfect one if you're writing normal assembly code.</p>
  <p>In general, I don't think it's possible to cover up significant amounts of imperfection. It's possible to use the Church encoding for numbers, for instance, but we don't do it because the cost
of introducing this abstraction is far too expensive. I would argue, too, that it's unnecessary. Purity is beautiful, but we're better off asymptotically approaching it than we are living in a
world where it's the only option.

  <h1>Syntax as a constraint</h1>
  <p>Someone at some point said something like "constraints breed creativity." It's an interesting thing to say considering that constraints also limit your options. But sometimes the burden of
choice is much more significant than the flexibility it provides.</p>
  <p>I'm running into this with <a href='http://github.com/spencertipping/mulholland' target='_blank'>Mulholland</a> and its very complex operator precedence model. The language doesn't present
enough of an opinion to guide library design, and as a result I'm not sure what to do with it. <a href='http://caterwauljs.org' target='_blank'>Caterwaul</a> didn't have this problem because
working inside Javascript's syntax was very limiting; there was rarely more than one way to do something. And it's one of the most useful (to me) things I've written. The necessary compromises
haven't held it back much at all.</p>
  <p>Put differently, syntax should be friendly both to library designers and to library users. Users, obviously, should be able to write what they mean and have that translated into something
useful. But more subtly, designers should have a set of constructive constraints so they aren't making decisions in a vacuum.

  <h1>Software reliability</h1>
  <p>When I was working for startups, it seemed like something was always burning down. The database would spontaneously become read-only, the middleware would sponataneously fail, or something
similarly catastrophic, and everyone would be in red-alert mode to try to fix the problem. It isn't hard to see why, either: we used brand-new technologies that weren't mature.</p>
  <p>Big companies don't seem to do it this way, and it isn't hard to see why. They can't afford the risk. (Using immature technologies is a huge risk, by the way; when we used Tokyo Tyrant, for
example, it would have started silently losing our data after we put more than 40GB into it.) Startups are lured into making risky choices by the promise of more rapid software development.</p>
  <p>At the same time, though, I wonder how many startups fail because they jumped the gun and tried to be more technologically savvy (in the use-what's-cool way) than their competitors, only to
end up with a technology Jenga tower that collapsed at some crucial moment (or worse, a development team whose performance was crippled by fighting fires). The ideal risk isn't blind, it's
calculated.

  <h1>Not invented here</h1>
  <p>I have a terrible case of NIH. This means I reimplement stuff that other people have written because I think I can do a better job (or based on other shaky reasoning). It does end somewhere; I
haven't yet written an operating system, browser, terminal emulator, machine-code compiler, or even a replacement for jQuery. But I have written a couple of programming languages, data
structure implementations, serialization formats, and other stuff that I could have gotten for free with open-source software.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, I'm not sure I want to outgrow this bad habit just yet. I've learned a lot by reinventing the wheel. It's also been productive in some cases; when I find a problem in my
stack I can fix it quickly and move on.

  <h1>Occam's Razor</h1>
  <p>In real life, true facts are often both counterintuitive and simplifying. Finding out that the earth is round is a significant mental leap considering that it looks flat from every angle. But
it simplifies our perception of deeper questions like gravity, and it explains how airplanes can keep going west and end up where they started.</p>
  <p>The same is true of great platforms and frameworks. Rather than obscuring things or creating noise, they use a less-than-obvious presentation of something that ends up making your world a
simpler place.

  <h1>Great abstractions</h1>
  <p>jQuery didn't take long to become the dominant Javascript library, and it's easy to see why. For someone who already knows DOM programming, it's trivial to learn and provides great ways to get
stuff done with less work. jQuery also managed to achieve a kind of minimalism; you can't remove much without changing something fundamental. And for many purposes, it has replaced the DOM.</p>
  <p>Another platform like this is the C programming language. It allows you to write assembly-level code far faster than you could in assembly, and it conveniently obscures the details of
architecture/platform-specific instructions and ABIs. The vast majority of C programmers feel no need to look underneath the hood of GCC, the linker, the calling conventions, the standard C
library, or any number of other complex pieces of C's infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Each of these abstractions has an interesting property: people who use them rarely find the need to work around them. Put differently, these abstractions don't leak. Most abstractions, of
course, aren't like this. For instance, X11 implementations use direct-memory rendering for local connections to provide hardware acceleration. All of the rendering could be done over its
network protocol, but it would be dog-slow and nobody would use it.</p>
  <div class='section level2'>
    <h2>Good abstractions vanish</h2>
    <p>  CPU-bound programs written in Perl or Ruby usually take much longer to run than the same programs written in C. As such, there's a case to be made against, for example, writing ray-tracers
  or programming language interpreters in Perl. C, on the other hand, is not appreciably slower than assembly language for the vast majority of tasks. For most purposes, you'd never know the
  result wasn't written in assembly to begin with, except that C is so cool that nobody would do that. (Actually, this isn't true. C imposes a lot of structure on the resulting assembly that
  makes it easy to detect. But none of this structure impedes the program's functionality/performance very much.)</p>
    <p>  Like C, jQuery also doesn't add much overhead. Last time I <a target='_blank' href='http://spencertipping.com/js-instabench'>measured it</a>, the cost of creating a Javascript object is 1%
  of the cost of creating an HTML element; although jQuery isn't erased per se, it is such a thin layer, and it's so aggressively optimized, that jQuery itself is rarely the cause of
  performance problems.</p>
    <p>  Here's where things get slightly counterintuitive: both jQuery and C will generally result in a net performance <em>increase</em> despite each creating some overhead over the perfect
  hand-coded solution. Not only do the abstractions vanish, but they result in a faster end product. And we use these libraries because low performance is one of the most harmful side-effects
  that an application can have.</p>
    <p>  Put differently, asking the question, <em>is using this abstraction making my application slow</em> is just as problematic as asking, <em>is my app failing because this abstraction has a
  bug</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='section level2'>
    <h2>Good abstractions are culturally accessible</h2>
    <p>  jQuery uses CSS syntax to select things, and while it did invent (as far as I know) its own accessor/mutator convention, this was so unsurprising and easy to use that things like Java's
  getter/setter pattern looked clunky and outdated by comparison. C allowed programmers to keep doing the kinds of cool stuff you could do in assembly (pointer typecasting, computed jumps),
  but made it easier and less error-prone to write programs with consistent structure.</p>
    <p>  Also, and just as importantly, jQuery didn't present some grand unified replacement for the DOM. Instead, it leveraged one of the DOM's core properties (the structured node hierarchy) and
  made it accessible in a reliable, cross-browser way. C didn't try to manage memory, create a new paradigm, or ignore the fact that you're ultimately writing machine language. Instead, it
  embraced these things and made them work consistently across every major platform (at least as far as the end-programmer is concerned).</p>
    <p>  The last, and perhaps most important, component of accessibility is ergonomics. C is much terser than assembly language for common use cases, just as jQuery is often much terser than direct
  DOM programming.</p>
    <p>  C and jQuery aren't the only libraries that have great ergonomics, of course. The UNIX filesystem and shell are also so useful that there isn't a decisively better alternative. Ditto for
  text editors as IDE components, despite how non-textual most programs are. Whatever design flaws these systems have, their ease of use is so compelling that we don't want to switch away.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='section level2'>
    <h2>Great abstractions withstand adaptation</h2>
    <p>  Adaptation comes in two ways. One is when the abstraction author changes something, often breaking code that uses the abstraction. This happened with Ruby; 1.9.x isn't backwards-compatible
  with 1.8.x, yielding workarounds like the RVM. Perl and Javascript are examples of the opposite; they have preserved horrible design flaws throughout their evolution so that old programs
  would keep working without modification.</p>
    <p>  The other, and more interesting, form of adaptation is when people start misusing something. A great example of this is the C++ template system, which was probably in no way designed with
  the idea that people would be using it for general-purpose metaprogramming. The fact that this misuse is so reliable that it has become commonplace is a significant compliment to C++
  templates. They have held up to unforeseen use where a lesser system would have broken down. The Web is perhaps the greatest example of misuse; what started as a simple linked document
  management system has ended up nearly replacing desktop applications.
